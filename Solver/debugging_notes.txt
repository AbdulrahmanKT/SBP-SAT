Last thing I checked were the SBP operators, and they have reproduced the SBP properties and compared with the sample n = 2 D matrix, which means that 
It is not a problem with the operators. Now, since the Advection equation is only using 

- convection (-2QF_ec)
- SAT_inv 
- Small dt yield small postive entropy rate that is growing. 

I suspect it is the SAT term (could be a sign issue)
